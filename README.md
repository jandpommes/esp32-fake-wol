**Key Points:**
- **Power**: ESP32 gets 5V and GND from motherboard USB header
- **Power Switch**: GPIO2 connects to power switch pin (pulls LOW when needed)
- **Power LED**: GPIO4 reads power LED voltage to determine PC state
- **No additional grounds needed** - USB header provides common ground
- **GPIO2 Behavior**: Pin is normally floating (INPUT), changes to OUTPUT only when pulling LOW

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing the Captive Portal

If the ESP32 is conncted visit it via its IP Adress or at http://wol-esp.local

If you're not seeing the captive portal login message, use these test files:

**Python Test Script:**
```bash
python test_captive_portal.py
```

**HTML Test Page:**
Open `test_captive_portal.html` in your browser after connecting to the ESP32 WiFi network.

**Manual Testing:**
1. Connect to "ESP32-PC-Controller" WiFi
2. Try visiting: `google.com`, `facebook.com`, or any website
3. You should be redirected to the ESP32 configuration page
4. If not working, visit `http://192.168.4.1` directly

**Visual Confirmation:**
- The captive portal should show a beautiful, modern interface
- All form fields should have proper validation and formatting
- Buttons should have smooth hover effects and animations

### Testing Wake-on-LAN

**Python Test Script:**
```bash
python test_wol.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 192.168.4.1

**Manual Test via Web Interface:**
Visit `http://[ESP32_IP]/test_wol` to manually trigger WOL

**Status Check:**
Visit `http://[ESP32_IP]/status` to see WOL configuration and status

**LED Behavior Verification:**
- WOL LED should blink exactly 3 times when triggered
- Each blink cycle should be ~600ms (300ms ON + 300ms OFF)
- Total sequence should complete in ~1.5 seconds
- LED should stop blinking and remain OFF after sequence

```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "state": "on",
  "stateText": "PC is On",
  "powerLed": 1,
  "wifi": true,
  "wolMac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "wolEnabled": true,
  "wolLedBlinking": false,
  "wolBlinkCount": 0,
  "wolLedState": 0
}
```

## 🔋 Power States

The controller tracks 4 power states using a reliable combination of front panel LED and network ping:

1. **OFF**: Front panel LED is OFF AND ping doesn't return
2. **STARTING**: Front panel LED is ON/OFF AND ping doesn't return (WOL message received)
3. **ON**: Front panel LED is ON AND ping returns successfully
4. **SHUTTING DOWN**: Front panel LED is ON/OFF AND ping doesn't return

### State Transition Logic

- **OFF → STARTING**: When LED turns ON but ping still fails
- **STARTING → ON**: When LED is ON and ping succeeds
- **STARTING → OFF**: When LED turns OFF and ping fails (startup failure)
- **ON → SHUTTING DOWN**: When LED turns OFF or ping fails
- **SHUTTING DOWN → OFF**: When LED is OFF and ping fails

### Safety Features

- **Startup Timeout**: If stuck in STARTING for 1+ minute, forces to final state (ON or OFF)
- **Shutdown Timeout**: If stuck in SHUTTING_DOWN for 1+ minute, forces to OFF
- **Ping Timeout**: If ON but ping fails for 1+ minute, assumes shutdown
- **Real-time Monitoring**: State updates every 10 seconds with ping checks
- **Maximum Transition Time**: Power states never remain in "powering on" or "powering off" for more than 1 minute

## 🌐 Wake-on-LAN Support

The ESP32 can detect Wake-on-LAN magic packets and automatically power on your PC. This is useful for:

- Remote desktop applications (Moonlight, Parsec)
- Network management tools
- Home automation systems
- Remote power management
- Gaming applications (Steam Remote Play, etc.)
- Server management and monitoring

### How WOL Works

1. **Magic Packet Structure**: WOL packets contain 6 bytes of 0xFF followed by 16 repetitions of the target MAC address
2. **UDP Port 9**: ESP32 listens on UDP port 9 for WOL packets
3. **MAC Address Matching**: Only packets targeting the configured PC MAC address will trigger power-on
4. **LED Indication**: WOL LED blinks exactly 3 times when a valid magic packet is detected
5. **Automatic Power-On**: PC automatically powers on when valid WOL packet is received
6. **Serial Logging**: All WOL events are logged to Serial Monitor for debugging

### WOL Requirements

- **PC Configuration**: PC must have Wake-on-LAN enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- **Network Support**: Network must allow UDP broadcast packets on port 9
- **MAC Address**: Correct PC MAC address must be configured in ESP32
- **Power State**: PC must be in sleep/hibernate state (not fully powered off)

**Note**: Some networks may block broadcast packets or UDP port 9 for security reasons.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ESP32 won't connect to WiFi:**
- Check SSID and password
- Ensure WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check signal strength

**Power button not working:**
- Verify wiring connections
- Check that GPIO2 is properly connected
- Ensure motherboard supports front panel power switch

**Web interface not accessible:**
- Check if ESP32 is connected to WiFi
- Verify IP address in Serial Monitor
- Try accessing `http://wol-esp.local` (mDNS hostname)
- Check firewall settings
- Verify mDNS is working: `ping wol-esp.local`

**Captive portal not working:**
- Ensure you're connected to "ESP32-PC-Controller" WiFi network
- Try visiting `http://192.168.4.1` directly
- Check Serial Monitor for DNS server messages
- Some devices may require manual navigation to the ESP32 IP
- Try clearing browser cache and cookies

**PC status not updating:**
- Verify power LED connection
- Check PC IP address configuration
- Ensure PC is on same network

**Wake-on-LAN not working:**
- Verify MAC address is correctly configured in ESP32
- Check if PC has Wake-on-LAN enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- Ensure PC is in sleep/hibernate state (not fully powered off)
- Check if network allows UDP broadcast packets on port 9
- Verify ESP32 is connected to the same network as the WOL sender
- Check Serial Monitor for "WOL magic packet detected" messages
- Try the manual WOL test at `/test_wol` endpoint

**WOL LED not blinking or stuck:**
- Check Serial Monitor for WOL LED debug messages
- Use `/reset_wol_led` endpoint to reset LED state
- Verify WOL LED is connected to GPIO15
- Check `/status` endpoint for `wolBlinkCount` and `wolLedState` values
- LED should blink exactly 3 times for each WOL packet received
- If LED gets stuck, it will automatically reset after 10 seconds

**Power state stuck or incorrect:**
- Use `/force_state?state=off` to force OFF state
- Use `/force_state?state=on` to force ON state
- Use `/force_state?state=starting` to force STARTING state
- Use `/force_state?state=shutting` to force SHUTTING_DOWN state
- Check `/status` endpoint for `pingResult` and `timeInState` values
- States automatically timeout after 1 minute maximum

**Debug and Logging Issues:**
- Check `/debug` page for comprehensive system monitoring
- Use `/get_logs` endpoint to get JSON format of activity logs
- Logs show last 20 events with timestamps and categories
- Clear logs manually using the "Clear Logs" button on debug page
- Logs include WOL detection, power changes, state transitions, and ping results

### Serial Monitor Debugging

Connect to the ESP32 via USB and open Serial Monitor (115200 baud) to see debug information:

```
ESP32 Smart PC Power Controller Starting...
Starting AP mode...
AP SSID: ESP32-PC-Controller
AP IP address: 192.168.4.1
Captive portal should now be accessible
Web server started
DNS server started for captive portal
UDP socket started on port 9 for WOL detection
mDNS responder started: wol-esp.local
Setup complete!
```

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- **Always power off PC before making connections**
- **Double-check wiring before powering on**
- **Use appropriate wire gauge for connections**
- **Ensure proper grounding**
- **Test with multimeter if unsure about connections**

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration
